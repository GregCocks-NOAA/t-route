Pruning Headwaters...
completed 1 iterations of headwater pruning
no more short headwaters to prune

Snapping Junctions...
-----
Finding non-headwater reaches
Prior to iteration 1: 5 short reaches existed in the network
-----
Finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 1:    0 short reaches remain
