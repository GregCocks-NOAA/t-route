Prune, snap, then merge:
---
pruning headwaters...
completed 1 iterations of headwater pruning
no more short headwaters to prune
**** Pruning the headwaters took 0:00:02.15 [HH:MM:SS.SS] ****


---
snapping junctions...
finding non-headwater reaches
Prior to iteration 1, 3 short reaches existed in the network
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 1, 0 short reaches remain
**** Snapping Junctions took 0:00:01.97 [HH:MM:SS.SS] ****
