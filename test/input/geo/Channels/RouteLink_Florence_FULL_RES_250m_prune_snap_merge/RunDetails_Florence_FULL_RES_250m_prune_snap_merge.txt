Time ALL Code Started: Wed Jan 27 23:17:42 2021
Supernetwork:          Florence_FULL_RES
Threshold:             250

Extracting and organizing supernetwork data...


---------
Prune, snap, then merge:
---
pruning headwaters...
completed 1 iterations of headwater pruning
no more short headwaters to prune
--> took 0:00:00.30 [HH:MM:SS.SS] to prune the headwaters


---
snapping junctions...
finding non-headwater reaches
Prior to itteration 1, 25 short reaches existed in the network
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 1, 0 short reaches remain
--> it took 0:00:00.29 [HH:MM:SS.SS] to snap the junctions


---
merging segments...
--> it took 0:00:04.78 [HH:MM:SS.SS] to merge the segments


---------
Exporting RouteLink file: RouteLink_Florence_FULL_RES_250m_prune_snap_merge.shp to C:\_projects\ShortSegments\github-clone\t-route\test\input\geo\Channels
Exporting CrossWalk file: CrossWalk_Florence_FULL_RES_250m_prune_snap_merge.json to C:\_projects\ShortSegments\github-clone\t-route\test\input\geo\Channels
Exporting unmodified RouteLink file: RouteLink_Florence_FULL_RES.shp to C:\_projects\ShortSegments\github-clone\t-route\test\input\geo\Channels
--> it took 0:00:00.73 [HH:MM:SS.SS] to export the datasets
