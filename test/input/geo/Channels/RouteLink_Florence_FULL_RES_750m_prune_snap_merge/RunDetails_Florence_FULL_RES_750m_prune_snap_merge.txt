Time ALL Code Started: Wed Jan 27 23:55:40 2021
Arguments:             Namespace(prune=True, return_original=True, snap=True, supernetwork='Florence_FULL_RES', threshold=750)
Supernetwork:          Florence_FULL_RES
Threshold:             750
Prune:                 True
Snap:                  True

Extracting and organizing supernetwork data...


---------
Prune, snap, then merge:
---
pruning headwaters...
completed 1 iterations of headwater pruning
completed 2 iterations of headwater pruning
no more short headwaters to prune
--> took 0:00:00.42 [HH:MM:SS.SS] to prune the headwaters


---
snapping junctions...
finding non-headwater reaches
Prior to itteration 1, 74 short reaches existed in the network
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 1, 19 short reaches remain
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 2, 4 short reaches remain
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 3, 2 short reaches remain
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 4, 1 short reaches remain
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 5, 0 short reaches remain
--> it took 0:00:00.85 [HH:MM:SS.SS] to snap the junctions


---
merging segments...
--> it took 0:00:06.14 [HH:MM:SS.SS] to merge the segments
