Prune, Snap, Then Merge:


---
Pruning Headwaters...
completed 1 iterations of headwater pruning
completed 2 iterations of headwater pruning
no more short headwaters to prune
**** Pruning the headwaters took 0:00:08.07 [HH:MM:SS.SS] ****


---
Snapping Junctions...
-----
Finding non-headwater reaches
Prior to iteration 1: 1 short reaches existed in the network
-----
Finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 1:    0 short reaches remain
**** Snapping Junctions took 0:00:05.00 [HH:MM:SS.SS] ****
