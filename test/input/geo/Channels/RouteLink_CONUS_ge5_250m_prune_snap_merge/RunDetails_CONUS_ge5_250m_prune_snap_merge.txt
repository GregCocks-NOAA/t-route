Extracting and organizing supernetwork data...

Prune, snap, then merge:
---
pruning headwaters...
completed 1 iterations of headwater pruning
completed 2 iterations of headwater pruning
no more short headwaters to prune
**** Pruning the headwaters took 0:00:05.78 [HH:MM:SS.SS] ****


---
snapping junctions...
finding non-headwater reaches
Prior to iteration 1, 1 short reaches existed in the network
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 1, 0 short reaches remain
**** Snapping Junctions took 0:00:03.30 [HH:MM:SS.SS] ****
