Time ALL Code Started: Fri Jan 29 14:13:07 2021
Arguments:             Namespace(prune=True, return_original=True, snap=True, supernetwork='CONUS_ge5', threshold=250)
Supernetwork:          CONUS_ge5
Threshold (m):         250

Extracting and organizing supernetwork data...


---------
Prune, snap, then merge:
---
pruning headwaters...
completed 1 iterations of headwater pruning
completed 2 iterations of headwater pruning
no more short headwaters to prune
--> Pruning the headwaters took 0:00:05.80 [HH:MM:SS.SS]


---
snapping junctions...
finding non-headwater reaches
Prior to itteration 1, 1 short reaches existed in the network
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 1, 0 short reaches remain
--> Snapping Junctions took 0:00:03.42 [HH:MM:SS.SS]


---
merging segments...
--> Segment merging took 0:07:54.22 [HH:MM:SS.SS]


---------
Exporting RouteLink file: RouteLink_CONUS_ge5_250m_prune_snap_merge.shp to C:\_projects\ShortSegments\github-clone\t-route\test\input\geo\Channels
