Time ALL Code Started: Wed Jan 27 23:44:06 2021
Arguments:             Namespace(prune=True, return_original=True, snap=True, supernetwork='Mainstems_CONUS', threshold=500)
Supernetwork:          Mainstems_CONUS
Threshold:             500
Prune:                 True
Snap:                  True

Extracting and organizing supernetwork data...


---------
Prune, snap, then merge:
---
pruning headwaters...
completed 1 iterations of headwater pruning
no more short headwaters to prune
--> took 0:00:02.39 [HH:MM:SS.SS] to prune the headwaters


---
snapping junctions...
finding non-headwater reaches
Prior to itteration 1, 7 short reaches existed in the network
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 1, 0 short reaches remain
--> it took 0:00:02.08 [HH:MM:SS.SS] to snap the junctions


---
merging segments...
--> it took 0:07:14.70 [HH:MM:SS.SS] to merge the segments


---------

Exporting CrossWalk file: CrossWalk_Mainstems_CONUS_500m_prune_snap_merge.json to C:\_projects\ShortSegments\github-clone\t-route\test\input\geo\Channels
Exporting unmodified RouteLink file: RouteLink_Mainstems_CONUS.shp to C:\_projects\ShortSegments\github-clone\t-route\test\input\geo\Channels
--> it took 0:00:53.28 [HH:MM:SS.SS] to export the datasets
