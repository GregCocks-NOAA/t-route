pruning headwaters...
completed 1 iterations of headwater pruning
no more short headwaters to prune
**** Pruning the headwaters took 0:00:00.33 [HH:MM:SS.SS] ****


---
snapping junctions...
finding non-headwater reaches
Prior to iteration 1, 7 short reaches existed in the network
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 1, 0 short reaches remain
**** Snapping Junctions took 0:00:00.27 [HH:MM:SS.SS] ****
