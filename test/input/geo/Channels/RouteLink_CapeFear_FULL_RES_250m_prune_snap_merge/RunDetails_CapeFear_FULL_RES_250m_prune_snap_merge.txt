Time ALL Code Started: Thu Jan 28 20:42:52 2021
Arguments:             Namespace(prune=True, return_original=True, snap=True, supernetwork='CapeFear_FULL_RES', threshold=250)
Supernetwork:          CapeFear_FULL_RES
Threshold (m):         250
Prune:                 True
Snap:                  True
Return Original:       True

Extracting and organizing supernetwork data...


---------
Prune, snap, then merge:
---
pruning headwaters...
completed 1 iterations of headwater pruning
completed 2 iterations of headwater pruning
no more short headwaters to prune
--> Pruning the headwaters took 0:00:05.75 [HH:MM:SS.SS]


---
snapping junctions...
finding non-headwater reaches
Prior to itteration 1, 463 short reaches existed in the network
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 1, 46 short reaches remain
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 2, 5 short reaches remain
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 3, 1 short reaches remain
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 4, 1 short reaches remain
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 5, 1 short reaches remain
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 6, 0 short reaches remain
--> Snapping Junctions took 0:00:11.49 [HH:MM:SS.SS]


---
merging segments...
--> Segment merging took 0:00:53.89 [HH:MM:SS.SS]

Exporting RouteLink file: RouteLink_CapeFear_FULL_RES_250m_prune_snap_merge.shp to C:\_projects\ShortSegments\github-clone\t-route\test\input\geo\Channels
Exporting CrossWalk file: CrossWalk_CapeFear_FULL_RES_250m_prune_snap_merge.json to C:\_projects\ShortSegments\github-clone\t-route\test\input\geo\Channels
Exporting unmodified RouteLink file: RouteLink_CapeFear_FULL_RES.shp to C:\_projects\ShortSegments\github-clone\t-route\test\input\geo\Channels
--> it took 0:00:07.86 [HH:MM:SS.SS] to export the datasets
