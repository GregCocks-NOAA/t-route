Extracting and organizing supernetwork data...


---------
Prune, snap, then merge:
---
pruning headwaters...
completed 1 iterations of headwater pruning
no more short headwaters to prune
--> took 0:00:02.27 [HH:MM:SS.SS] to prune the headwaters


---
snapping junctions...
finding non-headwater reaches
Prior to itteration 1, 19 short reaches existed in the network
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 1, 1 short reaches remain
finding non-headwater reaches
After iteration 2, 0 short reaches remain
--> it took 0:00:03.49 [HH:MM:SS.SS] to snap the junctions


---
merging segments...
--> it took 0:11:32.16 [HH:MM:SS.SS] to merge the segments
